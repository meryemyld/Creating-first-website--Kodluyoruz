    <div class="div1">Minimalist interior design is very similar to modern interior design and involves using the bare essentials to create a simple and uncluttered space. Itâ€™s characterised by simplicity, clean lines, and a monochromatic palette with colour used as an accent. It usually combines an open floor plan, lots of light, and functional furniture, and it focuses on the shape, colour and texture of just a handful of essential elements. 
        The minimalist approach uses only the essential elements: light, form and beautiful materials, usually in an open plan layout, to create a sense of freedom and relaxation. There is no excessive ornamentation and decoration. Instead, the few details that are used are uncomplicated and blend harmoniously into the setting. This might be in the form of a single artwork adorning a living room wall, or a beautiful vase on top of the dining room table.
        Minimalist furniture and accessories focus on functionality and practicality. Flat, smooth surfaces and strong, clean lines create bold statements that emphasise the essential nature of each item. You won't find highly patterned furnishings and accessories or highly detailed ornamentation. Instead, the focus is on the purity and simplicity of the shape and form.
        Clear and clean benchtops and surfaces, bare walls with minimal artworks, and the elimination of clutter, including piles of papers and collections of knick-knacks are also essential to creating a minimalist space.
        A monochromatic colour scheme consisting of whites, beiges and greys are typical of minimalist-designed spaces.
